(logo feedback appreciated)


- why?
	- abilene paradox, tactical voting, duvergers law
	- gridlock, ineffective committees, direct voting
	- collective illusions, better feedback
	- trust, delegation
	- drama, algorithms,
	- choice, agency
- why not
	- underlying problem is almost always social, not technical
	- software doesn't fix problems, action does



- decide things
	- create choices (templates for decision flow)
	- open individual decisions (allow proposing options)
	- propose options
	- discuss options along facets in wiki-format
	- make selections
- vote or delegate power (liquid democracy)
	- consensus-unanimus (for core things without time limits)
	- compromise-rcv (for debatable options)
	- lazy-concensus (for light edits/effort-based)
	- threshold-approval (for immediate ugent actions)
- maintain reputation/karma
	- actual choice selection doesn't impact karma
	- argumentative points impact karma
	- observer (non-participating) members can still affect karma
	- meta-moderation / failing to complete role duties
- user-controlled algorithms
	- feed
	- comments
	- search
	- discovery
	- decisions
