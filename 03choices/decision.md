a decision is a specific instance of a choice

- decisions link to their parent choice template
- decisions are basically articles
- decisions have a due date
	- this isn't the evaluation date (usually evaluated continuously)
	- just the last date you can vote/change votes
	- continuous evaluation is hidden until a minimum threshold (set by admins in the choice settings, recommend average/3)
	- show progress bar compared to previous elections
- facilitator considerations
	- keep in mind, zombie retweets aren't paper ballots
	- is there a vocal fringe outrage or does the community widely agree?
	- are you looking for compromise, or consensus
	- is there constructive dissent
	- are there coalitions building
	- is there common enough ground to get something done
	- are both sides okay with being wrong
- decisions assign who's allowed to
	- facilitator group
	- propose options (debator) (and criteria, it's also a decision)
	- approve options (and criteria, it's also a decision)
	- link criticisms/arguments of options & their approval
	- make selections
		- who can also mean whether delegated votes are allowed
			- concensus usually doesn't allow zombies
			- compromise usually does
			- threshold never does
	- what role the volunteers enter into (e.g. a candidate pool)
		- zombies can't auto-volunteer
- non-participating observers can still cast protest votes
	- protest reactions are hidden by default on the decision
- decisions have an instant resolver (that goes into the meter monitor for automatic mod alarms)
- notification of decision is configurable
	- most legal decisions have delayed notification
