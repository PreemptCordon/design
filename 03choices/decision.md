a decision is a specific instance of a choice

- decisions link to their parent choice template
- decisions are basically articles
- decisions have a due date
	- this isn't the evaluation date (usually evaluated continuously)
	- just the last date you can vote/change votes
	- continuous evaluation is hidden until a minimum threshold (set by admins in the choice settings, recommend average/3)
	- show progress bar compared to previous elections
- facilitator considerations
	- keep in mind, zombie retweets aren't paper ballots
	- is there a vocal fringe outrage or does the community widely agree?
	- are you looking for compromise, or consensus
	- is there constructive dissent
	- are there coalitions building
	- is there common enough ground to get something done
	- are both sides okay with being wrong
- decisions assign who's allowed to
	- facilitator group
	- propose options (debator) (and criteria, it's also a decision)
	- approve options (and criteria, it's also a decision)
	- link criticisms/arguments of options & their approval
	- make selections
		- who can also mean whether delegated votes are allowed
			- concensus usually doesn't allow zombies
			- compromise usually does
			- threshold never does
	- what role the volunteers enter into (e.g. a candidate pool)
		- zombies can't auto-volunteer
- non-participating observers can still cast protest votes
	- protest reactions are hidden by default on the decision
- decisions have a vote type
	- concensus-unanimous
	- compromise-rcv
	- lazy-concensus
	- threshold
- decisions have an instant resolver
- decisions can result in actions against a subject
	- membership entry/eviction
	- article locking/unlocking
	- preemptive preservation of evidence
	- de-ranking articles/groups/users
	- hiding articles/groups/users
	- removing articles/groups/users
	- removing delegation
	- changing documents
	- enough mod report reaction votes -> triggers mod process
- decisions voters make that change them individually are rare
	- these require site admin approval
		- negative examples: auto-eviction
		- positive examples: group TOS
	- voting isn't meant to be a punishment
- notification of decision is configurable
	- most legal decisions have delayed notification
- actions can be:
	- live
		- some action triggers can't be
		- some action triggers must be (preserving evidence)
	- fully automatic at close
	- click to approve
	- fully manual (write notes)
- list of actions
	- defined by decision
	- a watching decision
	- parents: erzat provisions / relay breakers / virtual packages
- in-site actions are reversable (with some side effects probably)
- decisions are logged (but don't log who made the decision)
- warning system:
	- unanimity (group think)
	- not recognizing disent
	- shot down without alternative
	- manufactured consent (debate of process document or selected document raised)
	- vilifying others (CoC violation / recall of moderators)
- mod decisions show
	- previous reports against perpetrator
	- previous reports by victim
	- previous usages of the rule (choice template)
	- mod wiki / guidelines
	- timeline of actions against the perpetrator (some automated, some static)
