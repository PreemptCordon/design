- choice types can be delegated (you're delegating a specific decision template) - as well as delegating a single one-off decision, or more broadly delegating an entire wiki category of them
- inverse of delegation is the delegation-negation operator (which prevents inheritence down trees you don't want)
- depth of delegation possibly important
- delegation must respect some kind of abstaining property
- delegation gives a lot of interia and in-group / group-think power - decisions without a lot of discussion should trigger waking zombies
- delegates are notified of zombies joining or leaving (e.g., follower notification)
- a zombie voting directly is not notified to the delegate
- a zombie may mute a delegate to not actually follow what they say (but still allow them to think they are)
