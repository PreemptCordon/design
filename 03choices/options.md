- options are sections (where a decision is a wiki article)
- options may be preferentially selected by users in a decision
- criticism of option is possible from other option authors
	- facet-approval
		- other option authors present sections per facet per option
- option owners may set preferences for second choice votes
	- this option-owner preference is taken into account unless the user votes exclusively this option?
	- usually when forking an option (and editing it) the previous option is marked as the second choice
