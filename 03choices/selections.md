selections (or reactions) are a user's decision about an object

this includes reporting posts, criticizing writing structure, and actually ranking options

reactions can include reaction-amounts
selections are usually visible to those involved except when involving mod actions
selections are redactable in the case of a user's GDPR deletion
selections are reversable in the case of a spam user's removal
mark down whether the reaction was a zombie or was live

under the hood, reaction tags are filterable properties about a post, any ad-hoc category can be reactable but aren't typically presented unless published by mods
- process tags
	- triggers (attach to documents)
	- state (draft, live votes, decided)
- tags are basically `#domain:predicate=value` resource description framework
	- because of this, they're filterable in discovery/search
- selection visibility
	- public (if you're a delegate it's forced to be)
	- private (if it's a direct vote it's private)
- karma impact
	- reactions that your post is badly formated
	- moderation reactions
- per-user impact
	- choice selection doesn't impact user karma
	- group terms / TOS do impact rights
