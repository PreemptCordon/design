- dehydration (cheaper storage at $.005/gb)
	- stale wiki entries move to s3 and out of database
	- admin holds (not viewable, not deletable)
	- user/group configurable
	- recently accessed objects not eligible for dehydration
	- some objects can be preserved from dehydration
	- some items cannot be rehydrated (admin holds, karma holds)
- dehydrated items are less searchable
	- search index still keeps them somehow? or at least title + tooltip description + metadata?
		- e.g. not full-text searchable
- your data exports
	- CSVs
	- markdown documents
		- frontmatter (for decision documents)
		- re-importing requires draft approval (like creation)
	- roles & delegation doesn't transfer (you should use fediverse migration for that instead)
