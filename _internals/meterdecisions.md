these are circuitbreakers for issues. They're different from discovery (which is per user) and are meant for mods to keep things in control

- meter decisions do hook into votes & evaluate instantly (like the vote resolver)
	- they can hook into
		- trends of users
		- view count trends
		- edit trends
		- decision state trends (e.g. constantly blocked concensus)
		- decision result trends (e.g., unanimous decisions)
- types
	- based on reactions
		- alarm for controversy circuit breaker
			- e.g. engage crowd control
			- auto-demote overly interactive (slashdot alarm) - mods can manually override to allow it to keep spreading
		- a special exception is the moderator bully-victim search.
			- this pulls up cases where a particular user is being harrassed excessively by someone else.
			- cause/detection
				- constant negative voting (direct, not delegated)
				- alarm for brigading / robotic reaction
				- following people to disagree with them isn't allowed. participating in a group/team is fine though
			- actions
				- downrank enemy's ability to find them
	- based on votes
		- unanimity (group think) on RCV
			- cause/detection
				- not a lot of diversity in option choices
			- actions
				- engage wake-zombies
		- constant blockers on concensus
			- cause/detection
				- repeatedly blocked concensus
				- specific repeat user blocks concensus
			- actions
				- can mute to allow user to continue blocking concensus
				- can transition decision to RCV compromise
				- split group into subgroups (make more cohesive purpose/scope in their wikis)
		- lazy concensus constant debate raising
			- detection
				- a user's proposals constantly go into committee (simple sabotage guide)
				- a user is constantly reporting someone else
			- actions
				- demote reporting user from reporting role
				- demote proposing user from proposal role
				- ignore reporting user (for specific time) and let them keep doing it
				- ignore proposing user (for specific time) and let them keep doing it
	- user feedback of process reform
		- detections: users raise these (they're decision forms / contact forms)
			- not recognizing disent
			- shot down without alternative
			- manufactured consent (debate of process document or selected document raised)
			- vilifying others (CoC violation / recall of moderators)
		- actions
			- modify process documents
			- modify admin membership
