an article is composed of sections

article visibility is configurable (public, group, private)

- articles have a title (text field)
	- articles begining with category: are hashtag-able. group-maintained/delegated hashtags are appended with @@group
- article bodies are composed of lists of sections
- article license
- sections are collapsible
- articles have a main parent category (but can have other categories)
- articles have a main maintaining group (usually inherited)
	- but linking articles can continue using old versions / have to approve accepting the new edits
		- they can of course delegate this to the maintaining group
- create decission regarding a particular paragraph (e.g., report it)
- locked edits
- subpages
	- discussion pages
	- drafts
	- versions
	- alternates
	- backlinks

- privacy redactions
- articles may reference a date/time (e.g. for a decision) - dates require mod approval before they appear on calendars
- articles may reference a region/location (e.g. for a group) - requires mod approval
- language prefixes (/en/, /en-gb/), link rel alternate hreflang=en-au, hreflang=x-default
- links have rel noreferrer
- if an article references another element, the author of the other element can be notified of the backlink
- display backlinks (hidden section vs unhidden)
