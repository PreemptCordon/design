- a draft is an unpublished markdown segment
- drafts are listable per user
- drafts are visible to the approvers of an edit
- edit approval logic is based off a choice template:
	- who's notified of an article edit (approvers)
	- after approval the search index changes
	- side-groups choose to approve the new version
- minor edit (no comment) vs edit with comment
