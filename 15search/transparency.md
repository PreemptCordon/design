- [ ] search transparency (per result / sitewide view)
	- downranking/calming factor (automatically applied during reports)
		- category/reason for downranking, magnitude in result
	- delisting/blocking (applied as reports are finalized)
		- category/reason, potential search hits lost
- search is ran both with and without the mod factor
	- this is available for the searcher
	- and for the article writer
- we don't track view counts, so it's really only search counts
	- you can still see boost / retoot / follow counts
- fraction of weight
	- mod transparency
		- a mod had (realized reports)
		- an automated system had (pending reports)
	- vs user ranking weight (split below)
	- takes longer to calculate: (uses the discovery ranking system)
		- your friends had (in-groups)
		- neutral users had (folks not identifiably on either side of your friend graph)
		- your enemies had (e.g. blocks, avoiding conflict)
		- show that graph over time for the mean / SD of whether someone would say it on a particular view
			- show the mean reaction (of each group to you)
			- show this specific reaction (of each group to you)
