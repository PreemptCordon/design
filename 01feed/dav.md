the app doesn't have a calendar view itself. it shares a DAV/ICS that you can use elsewhere.

- per-event ICS
- per group dav visibility (controlled by group)
- personal URL of shared events (password protected)
- calendar/date updates require mod approval (see wiki article attributes)
- this is a news-like feed (articles by dates)
- actions against you / affecting you
- position start/stop dates (combined or separate - if separate events reference each other)
-
