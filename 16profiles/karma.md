- the karma score result is public
- forgiveness vs washing score
	- karma decisions are rolling windows (to allow forgiveness)
	- marks that aren't choice-rankings go towards karma (e.g., RCV/approvals don't affect it)
	- multiple karma decisions go into the complete score
	- deleted posts still count towards karma score (because reported posts are permanent, if not visible)
- karma can impact someone's ability to do things
	- karma effects require site admin approval
	- karma-based permissions include group membership, rate limiting for repeated reports,
	- karma amnesty via admins is possible (via formal appeal)
- karma votable actions are not meant to be subscribable
	- mass-reporting is reversable
	- mute lists and block lists are allowed to be delegated actions
- idea-proposals (not meant to be karma but a problem similar to it)
	- established users can sometimes downrank newcomers
- invite-karma / recommendation karma
	- another user you promoted to a role abusing that role counts against you
	- mods above you can partially forgive that
