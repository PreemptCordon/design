- fair speech (speech that doesn't cause harm) vs free speech (which allows hate speech)
- incentive (game theory wise) to do the right thing (itterated prisoners dilemna/karma)
- conformity can prevent free expression. embrace positive deviance
	- don't let authoritarians silence your dissent
	- don't be fooled into thinking everyone believes some tradition
- temp actions are just auto-reactions. mods should always prefer banning nazis, not putting them in time-out (it's a twilight reaction)
