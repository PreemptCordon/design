- should definitely keep this in a wiki curated by different topic admins
- trying to balance out a few things here
	- letting quiet / marginalized folks speak up
	- preventing the group from getting too entrenched

- "don't be a dick" applies
- helpfully, most group items happen in very limited wiki-like contexts.
- approval of a tag attachment/reaction happens both by the facilitator and by the topic curator (e.g., setting #argument-source-missing)
- as long as folks leaving/entering a collaboration/coalition are doing so in good will, that's okay
	- e.g., an external group helping on X problem
	- a group with enough resources splitting off to become Y group
- karma here expires (on a sliding window), and that cuts both ways
	- super-positive karma folks who become inactive lose karma
		- this is important because newcomers might lack the karma compared to super-entrenched folks
	- folks who had bad karma in the past, and changed, can redeem karma
		- deleting/washing your posts doesn't remove negative karma. it mostly removes positive karma.
		- mod reports / legal report karma effects aren't removable. They're part of whether you're enough trouble to ban / part of security.
	- site mods can forgive wrongful karma
		- e.g., malicious reports by a specific user
		- filters to mute reports against a targeted account
- you can use karma and monitors to limit / traffic control interactions with your group or your wikis.
	- e.g. low karma for X reason (flamebaiting, the whole category trolling, etc)
- mod appeals
	- reporting starts with a report by a user (the accused won't see which user reported them)
	- this can trigger preemptive actions depending on your settings. Things like delisting a post from search. accused folks will/won't be notified according to your settings.
	- mods can ask for clarification, it will only show your role, not your handle
	- mods can give the accused opportunity for appeal/challenge (santa clara transparency principles)
	- the mods can then decide / trigger workflows - this can include restrictions on the account or damage to karma
	- final actions appear on stats
	- meta-moderation is the userbase's opinion of how a particular tag/discussion/report was handled. It applies to the karma of the curator of the topic as well as the facilitator of the discussion.
